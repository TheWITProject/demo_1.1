## Summary
You will be demoing tbe coding problems listed below.

## Instructions
Demo the coding problems below. Talk about what Python data types and operators you are using. Highlight the control flow for the solution.

Note: We are using a testing package in these questions. You can briefly mention what a package is and what a class is. We will be discussing this more extensively later in the curriculum. Focus more on how to read a test case. The exercises have comments that show example input/output and explain the text cases in plain language.
